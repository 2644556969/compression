This project applies model compression techniques from  "Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network - Geoffery Hinton et. al" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) and "Do Deep Nets Really Need to be Deep?" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6184). 

It uses the HE transformer library from https://github.com/IntelAI/he-transformer. Running the code requires HE transformer to first be installed following the instructions from that repository, then running `source $HE_TRANSFORMER/build/external/venv-tf-py3/bin/activate` so that the python environment containing HE transformer nGraph tensorflow bridge is activated. 

This project trains shallow models for MNIST in MNIST/Compressnets and CIFAR-10 in CIFAR10compress. Code for base models is adapted from https://github.com/IntelAI/he-transformer/tree/master/examples
